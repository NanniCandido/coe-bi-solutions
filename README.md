Contributed to process optimization and BI solution delivery within Yara’s Centre of Excellence (COE). Worked closely with Business Analysts to support the BI-Room platform—a self-service BI environment built on SAP HANA—by creating and optimizing SQL queries, validating data availability, and preventing duplication.
